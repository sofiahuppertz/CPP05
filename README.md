# C++ Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions

## Overview
This module focuses on implementing our own exceptions derived from the standard exception class, and using them with try/catch/throw statements.

## Key Concepts
- **Exceptions**: In C++, exceptions are a more explicit alternative to if/else statements for handling exceptional circumstances that disrupt the normal flow of a program. GitHub Copilot: **Exceptions**: In C++, exceptions are a mechanism for handling runtime errors or unexpected conditions that disrupt the normal flow of a program. They provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. When a function encounters an error condition, it can "throw" an exception, which is then "caught" by an appropriate exception handler designed to handle that specific type of error. This allows for more robust and maintainable error handling compared to traditional methods like return codes.

- **Concepts from Previous Modules**: Abstract classes, inheritance, using `const` and `static` keywords, orthodox canonical form, function pointers, and loops to avoid nasty if/else statements for scalability.

## Exercises

### Ex00: Bureaucrat Class and Exceptions Derived from Exception Standard Class
The `Bureaucrat` class can throw exceptions, which are caught by outer functions.

### Ex01: Adding Form Class Which Also Uses Exceptions
The `Form` class has `const` member attributes, which cannot be reassigned after initialization. The `Form` and `Bureaucrat` classes are dependent on each other.

### Ex02: Form Becomes Abstract (AForm)
To avoid repetition, we check requirements that are common in the base class function `execute` which then calls each form's concrete `execute` function. This is a more elegant and efficient way than checking requirements in each derived function.

```cpp
void AForm::execute(Bureaucrat const &executor) {
    try {
        if (executor.getGrade() > getGradeToExecute()) {
            throw GradeTooLowException();
        }
        if (!getIsSigned()) {
            throw FormNotSignedException();
        }
        local_execute(executor);
    } catch (std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
        local_failure();
    }
}
``````

local_execute() and local_failure() are pure virtual in AForm… but it’s fine to call them because AForm is an abstract class…

Each derived functions has it’s own local_execute() and local_failure() implementation, according to the subject’s requirements.

The target attribute is passed to the constructor of any derived class of AForm. Because I want to avoid repetition, I made target a private member of AForm, and created getters and setters for it.

### Ex03:
In this exercise we create an Intern class, which can create
based on a string. For this we use abstract class function pointers that return concrete derived classes. It is constructed in a way that would make it extremely easy to add a new derived class and allow for interns to return them… Way better than having an if/else long block
